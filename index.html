	           Every man should own at least one tailored suit. One to tell if a suit is too big is if the shoulders bunch when you raise your arms or when your arms are at rest. It is important to spend money on proper tailoring when purchasing a suit, because it really makes a huge difference in how the suit fits.  in the folllowing I will list off seven additional ways that you can use as a guide to making sure your suit fits properly.

	        	<ul>
	       			<li>Shoulder pads end with your shoulders.
					<li>Your flat hand should slip easily into your suit under the lapels when the top (or middle) button is fastened. If you put a fist in, the suit should pull at the button.
					<li>The top button of a two-button suit or the middle button of a three-button suit should not fall below your navel.
	        		<li>With your arms at your sides, your knuckles should be even with the bottom of your jacket.
					<li>Jacket sleeves should fall where the base of your thumb meets your wrist.
					<li>Between a quarter and a half inch of shirt cuff should be visible.
					<li>One inch of break.
	        	<ul>

	            As you can see, getting your clothes tailored makes you look taller, more mature and put together. Believe it or not, wearing clothes that fit makes you more comfortable and more confident. You should avoid pants with large breaks.

             	The case for Wearing a Belt:  Why would you not wear a belt?  Empty belt loops look plenty odd if they’re not in use.  It’ll be assumed that you just forgot to put a belt on before you left the house.  Besides, a belt is an accessory.  Last things on, first things to get noticed.  A belt gives you a quiet opportunity to show some more of your style.  Even if it’s minimalist and subtle.

	        <p align="left"> 
	        	The case for Not Wearing a Belt: suspenders are an alternative. They can have the effect of a cleaner look in compared to belts. With suspenders, there is no bunching up as is usually the case with belts if one is wearing anything but waist hugging pants. For this reason, men who are purists in dressing remain permanently hooked to suspenders. If many of your pants are ill fitting by a slight margin, this is a perfect reason to grab some suspenders and save yourself the hassle of adjusting your pants at the tailors’, besides, you run the risk of ruining them.

	            <li>traditionaly you want to match your socks to your pants not your shoes. The only acception is if you want to make them a creative color completly different from your entire outfit</li>

	        		 I would Buy leather shoes. Though more expensive, because it is porous, leather is the best for the health and comfort of your feet. In leather shoes the foot can breathe, discouraging the build-up of bacteria. Also you want the shoes should fit from the moment you try them on. Do not accept the salesperson’s, “Once you break them in they will be fine.” The man-made materials used today do not stretch significantly, but leather adapts to your foot shape quite well. You want about a half inch of room bewteen your toe and the end of the shoe, almost everyone has one of their feet bigger then the other.
